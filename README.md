## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run Locally
1. Make sure you have Python 3.11+ installed
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   # Create a new virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate
   
   # You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set your environment variables (or use a `.env` file):
   ```powershell
   $env:DOWNLOADS_PATH = "C:/Users/Plesu/Documents/File_Organizer/downloads/"
   $env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key"
   python app.py
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file:
   ```
   DOWNLOADS_PATH=C:/Users/Plesu/Documents/File_Organizer/downloads/
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   ```

## ÔøΩ File Organization and Naming
The File Organizer uses a smart naming convention that:
- Organizes files into category-based folders (images, documents, archives, etc.)
- Cleans up file names by:
  - Removing random strings and UUIDs (e.g., "3d0c1bda-5cee-4dca")
  - Eliminating timestamps and date strings
  - Preserving meaningful words and descriptions
  - Converting to lowercase for consistency
- Handles duplicate files by adding a counter (e.g., "document_report_1.pdf")

Example transformations:
```
Before: archives_validate_3d0c1bda_5cee_4dca_9834_20250819.zip
After:  archives_validate.zip

## ÔøΩüõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- If you see 0 files, make sure your local `downloads` folder has files
- Ensure the `DOWNLOADS_PATH` environment variable matches your actual folder path
- For any issues, check the logs in the terminal for errors
- If files aren't being renamed as expected, make sure they're not already in a category folder

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables
- `DOWNLOADS_PATH`: Path to your downloads folder
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key for AI features
